This file contains information about all the contents of this directory. 
This directory contains all the files related to the backend for EmpowerSkill. 
I have used Django web framework for the backend and it has been integrated with postgresql relational database management system. 
The integration of Django and Postgresql has been successfully achieved. 
Installed the library psycopg2 for the same.
The postgresql database will contain all the user data and other relational data. 
Besides me, the other collaborators of this project are the superusers of this django application. 

FOLDER CONTENT DESCRIPTION
manage.py file is required for running th Django server.
dp.sqlite3 file is not used for this project because we have changed databases from sqlite to Postgresql.

CURRENT UPDATES
Currently, I am working on integrating the Django backend with Reactjs frontend by making use of Django rest framework.
Django Rest Framework will convert the backend server into an API for the frontend to consume.
Installed djangorestframework and django-cors-headers libraries so far. 
Will need axios for connecting the frontend and the backend. 


Django has been connected with the ReactJS frontend. Everytime I launch the server and go to the url localhost:8000, the frontend shows up.
Installed djangorestframework for the same. 
The backend currently has 3 apps. 
A core app that launches the home page of the website. 
A blog app that will launch the blog page for the website.
A users app that will contain all the data required for the users' dashboard and profile. Mostly, the users app will be responsible for launching the dashboard and the profile page. 
Yet, the integration process isn't complete. I still have to integrate the frontend forms with the database. 
E-R model is being worked upon. I have made the tables for blog posts. 
The table for user profiles isn't complete yet. Will keep updating it.
