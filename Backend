This file contains all the backend related files. 
Backend has been developed using Django web framework. The relational database integrated with the database is Postgresql. 
All the user data and other entities related to the same will be stored in this database. 
*** Descision for how to store videos and images is yet to be made. 
So far only the connection of Django and Postgresql has been successfully accomplished. 
Currently working on linking Django with Reactjs by making an API of Django using Rest Framework.
